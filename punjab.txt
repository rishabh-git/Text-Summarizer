Recently, I went to Amritsar and Jalandhar during my school holidays, to meet my aunt, whom I had not seen for a long time. This visit made me realize that there had been tremendous changes since I visited Punjab last. Due to terrorist activities throughout Punjab, every community is completely nervous. After sunset, most of the people confine themselves to their houses. Almost all of them are caught in the horns of dilemma whether to leave Punjabâ€”a loving state where they have been living for years. The shadow of an unknown terror haunts everybody. The most surprising thing is that the communal feeling, which is supposed to be the root cause of all this tumult, is not so strongly present. It becomes very clear that this aura of never ending terror has been created by the selfish politicians and fanatic religious preachers. Everyday, at some place or the other, there is either a bomb blast or some gruesome incident of massacre. The grave situation has compelled the Central Government to impose Presidents rule in Punjab. But the problem has not yet been solved. The whole situation is messed up and the common man is the ultimate victim. Yet the thing to be noticed is that the deep belief in life which is the hallmark of the Punjabi people has not yet disappeared. They are ready to help, to fight and to begin afresh. This is the only tinge of hope in the strained atmosphere of Punjab.
