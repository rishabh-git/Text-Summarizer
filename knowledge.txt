Nature has bestowed man with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. It’s the result of this eagerness to know that we are enjoying so many boons of science of present. But this urge to explore and to know more is usually hampered by our laziness and feeling of self-sufficiency. Knowledge is desirable and should be achieved at any cost. But a little knowledge is certainly as good as having no knowledge. People with a little knowledge keep parading their knowledge. But a real knowledgeable man needs no praise and superficiality. Although it’s a common practice nowadays, to create much ado about nothing, yet we should always keep in mind that they are the empty vessels, which make much noise. Minds full of knowledge never try to show off. A little knowledge is indeed a dangerous thing if it is accompanied by self- complacence. But if it’s tinged with a desire to learn more, then man can attain higher achievements and then even sky will be no limit.
