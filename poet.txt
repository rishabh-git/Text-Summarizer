Literature of any language is adorned by its poetry, because poetry can convey the meanings beyond word using a few words. My favorite poet is William Wordsworth, a pioneer of romantic poetry in English literature. He had the courage and conviction to break away from the set rules and regulations of classical poetry and form his own poems independently. He wrote in the language of ‘humble and rustic people’. And the poetic subjects in his poems are simple and impressive. He experienced the profundity of innocence and simplicity of children and declared ‘child is the father of man’. Nature appealed to him as mystic and majestic presence which always casts an impact on human mind. His poetry draws us back in the soothing lap of nature from this world of teens and travails. In his love for nature he calls nature the ‘the nurse, the guide, the guardian of my heart/and the soul of all my moral being.’ He has this firm faith that close contact with nature can make us more human, kind and generous to our fellow beings. His poetry is sensitive, impressive and educative too. Among his famous poems, ‘The Solitary Reaper, Lines on Tin tern Abbey, On Westminster Bridge and Daffodils’—I like ‘The Daffodils’, the best. In it, describing the beautiful daffodil flowers, he conveys how nature can be a perpetual source of joy and solace to human heart. I always derive some inspiration and calm from his poetry.
